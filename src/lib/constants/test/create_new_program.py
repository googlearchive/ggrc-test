DESCRIPTION_LONG = u'"Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) are ' \
    u'three pillars that work together for the purpose of ' \
    u'assuring that an organization meets its objectives. ... ' \
    u'Governance is the combination of processes established ' \
    u'and executed by the board of directors that are ' \
    u'reflected in the organization\'s structure and how it ' \
    u'ismanaged and led toward achieving goals. Risk ' \
    u'management is predicting and managing risks that could ' \
    u'hinder the organization to achieve its objectives. ' \
    u'Compliance with the company\'s policies and procedures, ' \
    u'laws and regulations, strong and efficient governance is ' \
    u'considered key to an organization\'s success." [4] GRC ' \
    u'is a discipline that aims to synchronize information and ' \
    u'activity across governance, risk management and compliance ' \
    u'in order to operate more efficiently, enable effective ' \
    u'information sharing, more effectively report activities ' \
    u'and avoid wasteful overlaps. Although interpreted ' \
    u'differently in various organizations, GRC typically ' \
    u'encompasses activities such as corporate governance, ' \
    u'enterprise risk management (ERM) and corporate ' \
    u'compliance with applicable laws and regulations. ' \
    u'Organizations reach a size where coordinated control ' \
    u'over GRC activities is required to operate effectively. ' \
    u'Each of these three disciplines creates information of ' \
    u'value to the other two, and all three impact the same ' \
    u'technologies, people, processes and information. ' \
    u'Substantial duplication of tasks evolves when ' \
    u'governance, risk management and compliance are managed ' \
    u'independently. Overlapping and duplicated GRC activities ' \
    u'negatively impact both operational costs and GRC metrics. ' \
    u'For example, each internal service might be audited and ' \
    u'assessed by multiple groups on an annual basis, creating ' \
    u'enormous cost and disconnected results. A disconnected ' \
    u'GRC approach will also prevent an organization from ' \
    u'providing real-time GRC executive reports. Like a badly ' \
    u'planned transport system, every individual route will ' \
    u'operate, but the network will lack the qualities that ' \
    u'allow them to work together effectively. If not ' \
    u'integrated, if tackled in a traditional "silo" approach, ' \
    u'most organizations must sustain unmanageable numbers of ' \
    u'GRC-related requirements due to changes in technology, ' \
    u'increasing data storage, market globalization and ' \
    u'increased regulation. Un texte en français'
DESCRIPTION_SHORT = "Test description"
NOTES_LONG = u"Governance describes the overall management approach through " \
    u"which senior executives direct and control the entire " \
    u"organization, using a combination of management information " \
    u"and hierarchical management control structures. Governance " \
    u"activities ensure that critical management information " \
    u"reaching the executive team is sufficiently complete, accurate " \
    u"and timely to enable appropriate management decision making, " \
    u"and provide the control mechanisms to ensure that strategies, " \
    u"directions and instructions from management are carried out " \
    u"systematically and effectively.[5] Governance of risk " \
    u"management is the attention given to preventing excessive risk " \
    u"management by keeping in mind the organisation's appetite for " \
    u"risk. Sufficient countermeasures are required rather than " \
    u"excessive, unnecessary and pointless measures. The risk of " \
    u"risk management is that the good intentions become wasteful " \
    u"expenditure or impediments to growth, innovation and " \
    u"opportunity. Risk management is the set of processes through " \
    u"which management identifies, analyzes, and, where necessary, " \
    u"responds appropriately to risks that might adversely affect " \
    u"realization of the organization's business objectives. The " \
    u"response to risks typically depends on their perceived " \
    u"gravity, and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting or " \
    u"transferring them to a third party. Whereas organizations " \
    u"routinely manage a wide range of risks (e.g. technological " \
    u"risks, commercial/financial risks, information security risks " \
    u"etc.), external legal and regulatory compliance risks are " \
    u"arguably the key issue in GRC. Compliance means conforming " \
    u"with stated requirements. At an organizational level, " \
    u"it is achieved through management processes which identify the " \
    u"applicable requirements (defined for example in laws, " \
    u"regulations, contracts, strategies and policies), assess the " \
    u"state of compliance, assess the risks and potential costs of " \
    u"non-compliance against the projected expenses to achieve " \
    u"compliance, and hence prioritize, fund and initiate any " \
    u"corrective actions deemed necessary. Un texte en français"
